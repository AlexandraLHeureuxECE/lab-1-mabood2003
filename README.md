# Tic-Tac-Toe (LLM-Assisted Development)

This project is a simple, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players playing on the same device.  
It was developed as part of **SE4471 – Lab 1**, with a focus on **LLM-assisted “vibe coding”** rather than manual implementation.

The game includes:
- A visible 3×3 grid
- Alternating turns between Player X and Player O
- Win and draw detection
- Enhanced visual feedback for game outcomes
- A Restart button that resets the game without refreshing the page
